## Overview
Movies-Couch is the client-side part of the app, based on the existing server side. This movie app allows users to access information about different movies.
Users can register, update, their personal data, and manage as well their favorite movies.
I was the main Developer.
The client side user interface complements REST API and MongoDB database whcich have been set up previously, providing a smooth experience for users. Built with MEAN-stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), Movies-Couch is a full-stack web application which offers a user-friendly, responsive and efficient solution for those seeking movie information and management.
